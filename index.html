										<h2>Flow Shop Scheduling Problem</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/img_4.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 1em;"/>
									  <h3>Overview</h3>
                                      <ul>
                                         <li>The report addresses BMWâ€™s challenge of optimizing the job sequence for 800 car manufacturing tasks across 60 machines using advanced scheduling algorithms.</li>
                                         <li>The objective is to minimize the total processing time (makespan) while handling constraints like job-specific processing times and urgent delivery requirements.</li>
                                         <li>It explores the computational complexity of the Permutation Flow Shop Problem (NP-hard) and provides algorithmic solutions including Random Search and Genetic Algorithm.</li>
                                         </ul>
                                      <h3>Key Features</h3>
                                      <ul>
                                         <li>Data cleaning included outlier detection, missing value imputation, and correction of invalid processing times for accuracy.s</li>
                                         <li>Two metaheuristic algorithmsâ€”Random Search and Genetic Algorithmâ€”were implemented and benchmarked across subsets of varying sizes (10, 50, 100 jobs).</li>
                                         <li>Performance of both algorithms was analyzed using metrics such as makespan, mean, standard deviation, and computation time, with sensitivity tests on key parameters.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                      <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                                      <ul>
                                         <li>Random Search consistently produced lower minimum makespans across all subsets but with higher variability.</li>
                                         <li>Genetic Algorithm resulted in more stable outcomes (lower standard deviation) but was slower and sometimes less effective in reaching the lowest makespan.</li>
                                         <li>A final Random Search run on the full dataset (792 jobs) returned a best makespan of 51,939 in under one hour, showcasing its practical viability under time constraints.</li>
                                      </ul>
									  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
									  <ul>
										<li>The importance of balancing Variance and Bias i.e. balancing trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.</li>
										<li>Parameter tuning (e.g., population size, mutation probability) plays a crucial role in improving algorithm performance, especially for Genetic Algorithms.</li>
										<li>Effective data preprocessing and problem-specific insights are as vital as the choice of algorithm in operational research tasks like job scheduling.</li>
